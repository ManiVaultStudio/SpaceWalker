# SpaceWalker

Here, we present SpaceWalker, an interactive visual analytics tool for exploration of large patches of Spatial Transcriptomic data. SpaceWalker consists of two key innovations: a real-time spatial exploration of the HD gene expression space, and a gradient gene detector for on-the-fly retrieval of locally varying genes from the full gene set. We complement this with a suite of user-defined visualization options to inspect and query the data, and to project analysis results on the spatial data.

This software is described in the paper [**SpaceWalker: Interactive Gradient Exploration for Spatial Transcriptomics Data**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.20.532934v1)

# Installation
SpaceWalker is built as a plug-in for the ManiVault application building system as described in [**ManiVault: A Flexible and Extensible Visual Analytics Framework for High-Dimensional Data**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01751).

The installer of this software which includes the SpaceWalker plugin can be downloaded below:

Currently, only a Windows installer is provided, Linux and Mac will follow in the coming period.

# Example Datasets
In the paper several datasets are discussed which are available here for exploring locally via downloading a ManiVault project file.
